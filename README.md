# A FUCKING BIG-ASS DISCLAIMER: THIS IS STILL IN BETA AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK

steals memes from reddit, crops them and publishes to IG

okay so I suppose not many people who came here know hnow to do this shit so I'm gonna write down a step-by-step tutorial which will hopefully help


# 1: INSTALL PYTHON!

_the scripts are running on python 3.x_

go here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/ , scroll down and choose your preferred version 

blah blah blah take steps according to the installer or however do you want JUST INSTALL THE SHIT

okay so now you should have python 3.7 installed 

when you now download and extract the folder in your preferred directory (do it!) and try to run one of the scripts, they'll
probably give you an error - that's because you don't have the needed modules installed. Let's fix that in our next step:

# 2: install needed packages (modules)

NOW: open command line (win key+R, type in 'cmd' and hit run)
supposing you've installed your python distribution in the C:\ root, just paste in this command: 
`C:\python37\Scripts`
now you gotta paste every single of these lines and wait for the commands to execute
`pip install praw`
`pip install instagramAPI`
